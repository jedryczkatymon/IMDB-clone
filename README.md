# IMDb landing page clone

## 📖 About the project
This project is a web app that replicates the landing page user interface of the popular IMDb platform.

## 🎬 Viewing the project
Just go to https://imdb-website-clone.netlify.app/ and voilà!

## 💡 What I learned
It was my first project where I set out to code something big in React.js. I was afraid that in the process I will get lost in all those params, states and data fetching but I managed to conquer them.

Working on this venture gave me an insight into reverse engineering designs. It turned out to be quite difficult to replicate even simple features so that they look exactly like an original version, eg. carousel or dropdowns that were the most painful to recreate.

## 🚀 Features
It allows for further incorporating features like:
- searching by category;
- adding to watchlist;
- signing in;
- changing website languague;
I plan to add these features as soon as I learn some more backend.
